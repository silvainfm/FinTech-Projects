# FinTech Projects


This repository contains projects I have done for the FinTech bootcamp @ Northwestern. 

It demonstrates the skills acquired, such as: Python, SQL, Solidity, and other machine learning packages. 

Some of them were homework, mostly from the beginning of the bootcamp, and the rest are more self-guided projects.
